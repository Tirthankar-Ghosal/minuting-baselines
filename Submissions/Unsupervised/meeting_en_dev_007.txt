 (person4) so if you can scroll, to where i am, yep, so executive summary.
(person4) yeah, so that's a, that's a good question about the [organization1] presentation.
(person4) yeah, okay, great, so then if you click on our icons, either mine or or [person7]'s.
and, in the [organization6] sheet i'll put, the link to the source which is here.
(person7) well, i have a  of course i have several internal documents describing, for example, the architecture, the function analyses.
(person7) preparing, i will be really happy if overleaf documents start compiling but it's not problem.
(person4) on that was discussed on the [project1] call, so i'm and remote call the standard consortium wide thing.
ok, so we should ask [person1] and [person2], and, yeah, i'm emailing colleagues in [organization2], and [organization4] who of them could review the the deliverable.
(person4) i think two pages could be enough, because it's primarily a demonstrator and not the report.
(person7) we will also avoid  world functional analysis because, you know, it is really verbous.
(person7) we need functionalities to be provided, and next paragraph for example the architecture, how the information flow wo- works.
we would like to  the elg paper from that and the elg paper is due next friday, feb 21.
(person6) you will need to create special password for overleaf, but then it probably should work.
and [person6] please follow the structure that [person7] well, have suggested in that overleaf.
(person4) um-hum, well that's bit tech but the pdf got created, didn't it? yeah, and now it's, now it compiles seamlessly, and i'll do one more thing.
(person6) hi [person7], this is [person6], i'm actually [person4]'s colleague from you know back like 13 years, actually remember me and him taking some some lecture.
(person7) yep, i i cloned the git repo, i've just pulled all the last modifications.
(person7) oh, don't worry, i also do not remember my  manager, which one is, but just give me one second.
