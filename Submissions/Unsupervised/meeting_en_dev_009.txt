 and that that aplies also to [person14], [person15] and [person5] of course.
(person2) ok, so so what would be your collaboration with [person6] then if you if you were available? so i used two different segmentation for this, one is timebase and second is wordbase anyway everything is almost ready.
 (person2) but for for the evaluation we have now something that we can do  we will actually sometime.
(person2) so no, we have only one recordings translated into [location4] and [other1].
so i've experimented with various technics and especially like domain adaptation of a language model and then acoustic fine tuning on [person3] talk.
(person2) so that's something that we're just testing and [person1] said that he would evaluated.
[person1] has found the appropriate command flacs so that the audio is compress to mp3 then shiped as mp3 to network and then decompress before being sent to the asr.
so so are you waiting for [person18] also please getting (dash) with [person1] because i think that [person1] made be more responsive these days.
 (person9) okay, if it is still deleted then i can then i can started next week.
if you don't get any response from [person18] even after the weekend then please make sure to to like treasure ask for that yourself without waiting.
so, i think that's we should stop again today it's then spent more time we wanted.
