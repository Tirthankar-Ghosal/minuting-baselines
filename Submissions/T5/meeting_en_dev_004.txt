cnn's john defterios has accepted a paper for a boot as a book .
he says he read the reviews and they are very good .
but he doesn't know if there will be any real participation .semi-virtual organization will be considered but as an optional addont .
i will try to register today and should be soon enough .
[person13] yeah, i can take part .[person8] i have no holiday and - [person13] maybe on, ne, on monday i am not here .
[person10] we don t have to write it right now .
what is missing is the book and one long paper, but it can be a [project8] paper .this is the last one.
[person13] july.
so in this year this is it .
i promise three papers on big confe-, conferences or type d .
and i am done with teaching this semester so i will just work on the book from nowone so maybe we can, everyone can say what was done last week .lorem ipsum's book 'notintelligible' is out this week .
he says he's working on a rewrite of the chapture .
but he doesn't have to worry about notable models .
the book is out now and he hopes to see it published .[person13] so far there are only some, i don t - [person8] unintelligible> .
[person12] so i think it would be hard to introducing you to laughible> now .
i will (regenerated) maybe more, more to the on [project3] as well .[person8] i haven t continued with this, this week so but i would like to finish it somehow .
this is for, from the past week i, i already written so do you so so, [person13] .
i ve added something but it is more coherened but it still, yeah, changed somehow if you try to post so yeah .i still dream that we could have it somehow at the end of at june in some share unintelligible> which is readable and we passed it to the reviewers .
i don t want to do it now because when we know that the deadline is postponed we will not do anything .
do we know, um, who will get reviewers? so are we supposed to get them?[person13] the deadline is, it was posponed to the middle of august .
if you resend it from [project7] to black box you trough had the reveiw-, the, the reviews there .
[person8] in november.
then it s virtualised as well .
so [person4] will be there in, in 2021 .[person10] that make no sense to participate remotely because maybe some people want be able to travel .
[person13] so if it s physicall then - [person8] yeah, if .
it's fysicall it will be nice so...
[person5] have try to send it there an older unintelligible> .[person13] that i don t unintelligible>.
[person8] but you will get some of the ph.d.
money if you get .
half of the salary you get and half of .
the salary just typicall the 'uninteligible' of the money .
i think it is possible and would be the best .[person13] we cannot pay bonuses because of the corona crises .
[person10] this month, i also got more money than usual .
the money cannot be spent, we, yeah, we can buy some stationary .[person13] it was not allowed to buy computers or this things .
[person10] he bought the computer that he is now using for some grant .
if he will pay for all the unintelligible> for [project7] or for black boxes to we will not end up with much more .i don t know what does it mean all of us but we can come .
[person8] unintelligible> says that we can deal with [person7] and [person9] so maybe - laugh> there is a food if - [person10] oh, yeah .
