by the end of november should we uhm get some new aligned data .
by using [person4]'s tool.
and already made by annotators .
(person5) i 'm not really sure if we should not no no.
but i don't think that we can put that in the proposal'if we don't use unintelligible> in the fast shared task, we'll mix up too many things in one in one place .
uhm, i'm not sure if understand all the details.
(person3) so i would propose that .
this should definitelly go in the background.
but ah, for the alignment .
tool is gated accepted by the community .uhm evaluate some meetings based on the automatic evaluation metrics that we have .
and then show unintelligible> to all of us, and then compare them .
i want to know what i do myself to be as af- so effective as possible .i think we should begin unintelligible> take the charge .
i would be fully focused till november 30th on the shared task proposal .
[person4] is not working for that, so i don't know how this tool works .once the tool does the alignment, so what is the output of the tools? uhm yes, this is an important question, but this is not just for that.
(person3) yes, we need a unintelligible> idea how to use it.i i absolutely support you that we should start this alignment thing with our annotators.
soon .
but i don't know how technical.
because the tool is actually ready, but there is some connection is missing that .if you want to transfer it's okay with me, but i think i 'm a bit too much uhm like worried about the proposal .
so i'm looking forward the start (date??) for the annotations from monday on worse .by the end of the week, we will have answers to all of this to connect to the annotators .
(person3) yeah, and probably excludes some unintelligible> meetings, and some other meetings .(person3) yeah, yeah.
(person5) i'm looking forward to that [organization1] data to unintelligible> by the end of this week .
uhm we don't have the con- concrete topic to ask him, so so i didn't do it .
