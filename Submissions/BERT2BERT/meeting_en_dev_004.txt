what is missing is the book and one long paper, um, but um, uh, but it not really related to, um.
um, oh, yes, it can be a [ project8 ] paper, vision deadline july 1st.the deadlines are in the, um, two, jurnals and one dedline as on big confe -, conferences or type d.

this is the last one, so we need one, one more paper, so if we have nothing and...
[ person8 ] hm.the book, " person8, " is out nowone so that someone can read it.
the author says he's starting to get to the book from nowone.
he says he hopes there will be more written today and on thursday and definitely on thursday.
the book is set to be released thursday and is expected to be out on friday.a lot of information has to be added so we can see what morfology is captured and how will it be captured.
" i don ’ tt no.
one, who is responsible for the chapture? " says one of the other models.
" there is no big difference between the individual models and what they called it, " said one." i don'tt think it looks nice but it is at least something that you can criticize and, re -, rewrite, i thought it ’ s very to have something that we can start with then have lorem ipsum, ipsum.
ipsum's ipsum is the title of the book.cnn's jeff zuckerberg has created a series of visualisations for the project.
he says it's not just a visualisation, but a way to get the same or the same metrics from the project 3.
but he says there are more than one word at the input and the other is the same one.person5 will write it only once and no twice.
it should continue by the section with, um, get syntax from, from the self - attention heads or getting syntax from self attention heads.
person5 is going to write in his survey as well as the section where it's written.a section of attention heads is not interpretable on why, there are not or why it should be interpretable.
it's something similar on the two chapt - um, um, this we get the same paper, or maybe i will, yeah...
we ’ re moving forward now, this week so but i would like to finish it somehow, maybe i won't." person13 " writer says it's'cohere but it still, uh, changed somehow if you try to post so yeah, it is still, " we are in the book's book.
we passed it to the reviewers and the reviewers passed it on to the reviewer's reviewers.if we have nothing to do with the book, we will find someone, someone, somebody but, who will get the reviewers? " i figured they need to be from outside this building, outside this, outside, outside - - outside...
i already talk with him and he said that that, yeah, we'll do it somehow and we will have like more money on this grant because of that.the deadline is, it ’ s possible it will be virtual anyway so, um., it is also the reason.
[ person8 ] i don ’ tt have profit < unintelligible...
but you don'tt need to - [ [ person ]8 ] so it is possible it.
could go to some better place than [ project4 ] only.the conference is november or july.
the conference will be in november.
it's the first time the conference has been called'officialy virtualised'the conference should be in the uk in 2021.
it will be there in 2021 and in 2021 in the u.
s.if you want to go to location7, it will be virtualised and they expect maybe some people to be able to travel.
it's possible that there will be some people who want to travel remotely.
if you're interested in the project4, it ’ s possible it'll be remotely controlled.the book is out on june 15th.
it's about a person8.
there are more than 1, 000 copies of the book.
it ’ s just like a hartch's number of papers,'says the author.'i think have try to send it there an older < unintelligible level of paper 'if it's not accepted for regular paper that - [ or ] unintelligible - on words, then then it'll be.
if it doesn'ttweet it, then you can withdraw it.
if you cross submitting to like other place than [ project4 ], you will see and write how the paper is written some nice thing.' we can, we can buy something on equipement or i - [ person8 ] to introduce you,'said one person8.'i think it is possible and would be the best option...
but we have always liked the survey like ( sixtate ) 60000 so we can move, transfering money to the salaries but we all, however, don't, want to use it '' it ’ s probably the least wasteful way of spending the money on...
but it makes sence.
it is probably the.
least wastefully way of spend the money,'says the writer.'i don ’ t think it will be the next year,'he says.if you distribute the money you can give him to as little time as possible.'it could be the same...
if you distributed so much money in one month so that all of it will be cut away.'' i just realized i gots like twice the, um, twice the., um., twice my salaries.
'the money cannot be spent for bonuses, we can buy stationary and i don'tt know.
the money is the only transfering money from one, um, or from some travelling to salaries or something else, we just need ask for it.'maybe they will always < unintelligible...
and maybe for, for.
physics they can, they can buy do - - it was not allowed to buy some computers or this things '" person8 " was created by a person8 member of the same organization.
it's now available to buy from amazon.
com for $ 1.
99 or $ 2.
99.
it is not like investicni naklady, but it is cheaper for people to buy it.if he pays for, he'll have to go trough some formal process or pay for black box notifications.
if he's paid for, it'll be hard to use it anyway.'if he will pay for [ project7 ] or for black boxes to, to we will not end up with much more 'a message from person8 got the message from a person7.
it said that we can come but we can't come.
we can end this meeting so we can - yeah.
we should say that, and maybe we don't want to let us in so we don ’ t have do.
