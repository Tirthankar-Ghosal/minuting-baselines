com / impact.the book is here and now you can select the book.
it is the book the cabel from the < unintelligible > long enough? it ’ s here...
and we can select a - ok, i will select like [ project6 ] book.
now, you can choose the - ok.the writer of the book is still missing the introduction so he split it into constituency syntax, dependancy syntax and some other things that i go ( up on ) syntax, depending on the context and context, for example, is missing before this somebody do something better ( to be fine, or maybe - - just a minute.word senses this is already there, but i don't know if it's ready.
it ’ s written to the debiassing which i don ’ tt think it is ready...
but it is a bit polishing.
we've got a survey re -, related to this one, and we're looking at what it means to us.we can read it now and comment it, so we can comment it.
[ [ person ]19 ] should be mostly in a good shape...
it ’ s the self as someone else work?'' i don ’ t have any < unintelligible opionion with - [ person19 ] and al did that or we did that,'he said.the " odborna kniha " - - or " person19 ) hm.
what ou - - is our general awork so we can if we refer to our work in the same way as, as the other.
" we agree that our work is doing the survey, i dontt see problem there, " says the writer.if you refer to your paper as someone else ‘ paper it looks like, um, what do you call it in english, like...
or.
um, that you present your work in context of the other papers that i refer to.
[ [ person ] ] paper is not how the same authors as the authors of the book anyway so it is like on some other papers like survey.the reader has the right to know that - person9 hm.
hm.
we wouldn'ttweet choose - person'paper you i ( disbiass ) from the reader's paper'the reader - your paper is the good one.
it's not really showing the part and espects of the multilingual representation,'says the reader.the author of the book, " person2, which is not, not really the case, " says it gives a feeling of like, a feeling for the authority of the paper.
this is still us thinking that our < unintelligible...
is better than, than the other one, " he writes.the reference has to be there in any case.
it's probably more but...
than.
person19.
we should ( agree ) to say we and.
[ [ [ person ]19 ] hm.
[ we ] would say, we.
both [ [ people ]re like [ the ] - person19 ’ hm.
we.
would say [ [.
person ] [ person6 ] [ hm.
] [ [ the.
author ] and al.
[ person19 ] ] [ the author ].what is the best motto? what is what is not there? what's what is missing there or what isn't there.
what is there, and what is it? what does the chapture full off ugly arrows is still there...
it ’ s still there, but there is no way to do it.word2vec was copied by [ person6 ] - - or...
that ‘ [ [ person2 ) ’ s ] ] – - - as well as.
the.
notable neural models started 15 years before [ project2 ].
the language models should maybe be merged to the previous chapture or.
deleted if it..
( deleted if ) ( ( deleted ) if it does ).if you find that is ok, you can delete it.
the first part, um, is com - - it ’ s already complete, according to what i ’ ve written.
if we like there, there is more potential interesting things that we could write about if we read it carefully.the acl tutorial, um, mention these methods only for visualisation.
it also uses pca quantitatively ( visualisation ) to identify the, or even, gender biass component.
this uses clustering which even evaluates for the multi indentification.
it's also used for visualising the multilinguality component.
it ’ s also a visualisation but it'll be available later this year.' we should say what we mean by probing and.
putting the history of this theme in the.
past it was these model,'said the ica tutorial.'we shouldn ’ t mention it...
it ’ s a good question,'he said.'i don ’ t think we should mention it 'we can still say in this chapture that there is another way of testing the models.
we are not interested in these methods...
but we aren't interested in them.
we don't want to test the models and, in this instance, that we're not interested.we can look at the slides on the tutorial in the slack link.
here are the slides, all 190 of which are freeliveable.
we can also look at what is in the interaction part of the interaction.
we're not sure if we want that as a section about interaction." person19 " is an interactive visualisation of what was terrible at this meeting.
here are some examples of what can be later in the book at all times.
we're happy to find out more about what happened at the meeting in the middle of the day.
we need to know if we'll be able to understand what happened.the interactive visualisation is like a technic ( dot ), can speed ( approaches ) exploration but they don't really consider it, say experts.'i don ’ tt know how this ( user ) like what was the embeddings...
it doesn ’ t seem that they mention any other method,'says the user.the classifires of the corel is concerned with, um, the probe complexity and probe quality and compare them.'we should always choose the most complex probe since it will maximize the mutual information,'said one of these papers.'i ’ m not sure that i follow this argument here,'says one of the papers.the conclusion was that like people are discussing it and there are different approaches.
we should mention the behavioral analysis ( we can ), we should explicitely mention that our classification is some what uncommon when the accent un - is un -, unsupervised methods ).like for example in case of biass detection you ‘re constructing, um, this is also unsupervised method, the neural...
doesn ’ tt.
but yeah, maybe it ’ s something that doesn'tt itself ( thinking about it )'we should follow [ person ] on, in classifying like the probes.
but maybe it – something else.
’'maybe it is something.
that ’ s what we should - [ person )9 '" morfology translation to the most of the behavioral, tested on the task for which it was trained kind of.
[ [ [ person ]19 ] yeah, we ’ re using just kind of observing the structure of the.
behavioral, testing specific thing - - [ person6 ] yeah.
we ’ ll write them.
so...
so [ person9 ] you can write the probing and -.
-.
someone who should - - - probing - - someone who.
should - yeah." what we should do with this hidden state ( could ) work...
across of all the, all the chaptures done.
across all the.
chapture, there is another subsection about word sense subword.
[ [ person ]19 ] hm.
[ ( person9 ] hm ] [ [.
person6 ] ] ( (.
person9 ) ), [ person )6 ( ( person6 ) ) ( ( [ person 6 ) ) or..
[ person.6 ] ).
[ what.
person ] ] : [ [ [ user9 ] doesn ’ tt ] have any hidden stateson twitter, you can comment and then comment on the comments.
here are some of the comments we want to do with comments on comments.
we're going to do a separate call and discuss the comments on twitter...
and when we read it we can comment on it.the best thing i'd like to add in to this column is what i was suggesting to add.
i don't know what the comment means, but it's not here somewhere.
i'm not sure what the comments mean...
or what i've been suggesting.there is no < unintelligible - - [ [ person ] ] we ’ ve had nothing in common with nlp, they have nothing to common in lingu - - what linguists and we are using methodology, um, that comes from different fields, they say.' there are only list of < unintelligible...
but there is no general consensus on what interpretation means'' we should say'in the machine learning community, we should mention'the chapture that [ person ] has, so do you think into the attentions,'said the writer.writer says he doesn't think that it's important to mention who the people are but that it is important to talk about the thinking general.'i don ’ tt know if there are stories like that but my chapture is end of story...
and i don'tt think that is - [ person9 ] change the name.the second part of the first part shouldn't be named stories and why is there this third part? we should come up with some more specific name...
and why isn't there this page? [ [ person ]19 ] yeah, this is actually, it should be the, yeah, maybe, maybe it shouldn ’ tt.
[ [ [ or ] it shouldnt be a separate part.the only chapture of the third part is the summary of the whole book.
it's not very clear if this is all.
it would make sense to part a part after the third...
but it would also make sense.
to separate the two parts of the book." the book is, yeah, it ’ s not really - yeah, the title isn ’ t really.
the book isn't so.
i dont know.
whether representing words...
is - 50 is the minimum i guess or? [ [ person ]9 ] yeah, this is - person9, but it is not so i should < unintelligible.if summary of the conversation we don't think it will be better if summary were somewhere else.
we don ’ t have it...
it ’ s the same as.
[ [ person ]9 ] yeah, it is not really part of the text.
but in the introduction we dont have it,'it is said.'i dontt think the summary is usually not numbered 'the book has not yet had a summary.
it has a glossary...
and also we have the roman number there.
it doesn ’ t have a summary of what is missing.
it's not the first time the text has been unintelligible.
it ’ s almost finished - - it doesn't have summary status.comment mainly what is missing - and what connections i mean in the chaptures and - - is what to remove.
the ideal comments for me would be what to removed...
and rewrite it.
what exactly exactly is what exactly is missing? and if we shouldn't forget to unintelligible, what is that?what is missing in my part is rewrite or add something to the last line...
but it can be somehow < unintelligible.
i will check the list of figures maybe we should add, but just add it to the list.
i'm not sure if i'll be able to read it again.' i donttt know where i will be online the next week, but maybe i will, so...
will we < unintelligible.
but we can, so in two weeks or? [ [ [ person9 ] hm ] we can make, yeah, we can.
make, uh, yeah.
we can also make, maybe, but we don ’ t want to, right now, when we have the tuesdays '" we can, we can.
com,.
[ person9 ] to the final report if i write,...
to the.
final report.
" we're not here this week and the next week you are here, next, next week.
we only wait for, um, to write to when everything is, everything is written, " says person9.the next meeting would be in, um, tuesday, according to the calenar says.
we can reach all the sections somehow and respond to the recomments as [ [ or ]...
and..
[ [ [ person ]9 ] or [ person9 ] ] [ [.
person ] 9 / 11 ] hm.
[ it should be better if you.
[ person )9 or..
anyone else." person9's meeting after lunch if you want, the meeting after would be ok, " said the author of the book.'i can - [ person9 ] it is - not problem < unintelligible...
it ’ s not problem,'says the author.what are you saying to someone who could review it? ask someone from location 3.
or you can ask a person from location3...
you can see - i can ask anyone from anywhere else.
the person9 said they should be non - unintelligible.'i don ’ tt know what i am.
i ’ m a.
person9.the email was like come and have a drink in the middle of the work day.
it was like being already retired but still professors.'i can't.
[ person ]19 ] was it.
but then also a very implicite and -...
and - - it seems like - - - and - / / person19 'we should have gathered and listened her to unintelligible...
we don ’ t have wine here or do we?'' you probably do have wine but we dont know it.
[ we ] have discussed everything.'' we've discussed everything,'said one person.the author of a new book, we should have the name of person9, has some grant.
interpretability is < unintelligible, his team...
and he should learn what we are doing.
the author says he doesn't think there are some people who are more than the same.'i don ’ tt know who kind of people we are,'he says.the book is also titled'unintelligible'it depends what kind of reviewer we want.
reviewer :'people who know about it will see what is missing but we will, we don'tt know about this who will see more like - [ [ [ person ] ] ] [ person9 ] yeah, we are still there.
here...
we don ’ tt understand.
what." person9 " is a social networking service that allows users to post a book.
it's like'unintelligible ', but it ’ s like what it is saying.
the user9 is a person9, but what you - person9's name is.
