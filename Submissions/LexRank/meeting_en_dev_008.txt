it is the – it is the (rolling) [organization2] link, we can use it <ehm> like for – for all (of our meetings), so – (person6) yes, okay, nice.
(person6) <mmhm> <mmhm> (person5) so, i – i wanted (to note) that – <ehm> so, (i didn't know) <unintelligible> – it was like – (i don't think there is) <unrecognisable_speech> there is the – <ehm> everything i <unintelligible> clean manually corrected transcript as well as <unintelligible>.
(person5) i – i – i want to know that how do you have <unintelligible>?
like, how do the <unrecognisable_speech> (person6) <ehm> okay.
(person6) if i <ehm> – if we look at it together and i will just <ehm> detailise some things that you want to know <ehm> – so <ehm>, <ehm> i will send you a link to minutes annotation, so that you can open it now.
(person6) <ehm> <unintelligible> is right that [organization2] is not working (for) <unintelligible>.
<ehm> so – (person5) but [organization2] meet is also free for fourty minutes, but i want to <unintelligible> [person6], how like <ehm> [person5] <ehm> like (be have got like the paid for <unintelligible> [organization2]).
so if they really ask for that, i can – i sometimes send them <ehm> just for – once <unrecognisable_speech> they look like, but mostly – (person5) but <unrecognisable_speech> what is the original minutes?
(person5) okay, so i would like to ask you now – so, by this original meetings, what <unintelligible> [person5] and [person2] (has) created, so it is just for (reference of the annotators).
so <unintelligible> – (person6) this is just for what?
it's not – so this is also the output.
ondra – [person5] is very much for that so that we really do that (gatehub) team and they can push and pull the data to the gatehub.
<ehm> but at the moment i'm not ready to say how it should be organised, because i have to give them <ehm> tasks <ehm> s- i have to say them 'now you <ehm> write this and that – this meeting' <ehm>, i have to correct it, so i have to look if their transcript and the minutes are <ehm> okay.
(person6) yes, but after <unintelligible> – (person4) but i think we – i think we agreed that they will keep communicating with you in the same way and that <unintelligible> will manage (log it up) – (person6) well, well – (person4) <unintelligible> what you will – (person6) [person4], not really, because afterwards, after that meeting, he said me many times h- that he still s- sees that it should be maybe changed.
(person6) probably (we should) – (person4) so, [person6] – (person6) not exclude this option for the moment, <ehm> but – (person4) okay, so, [person6], i – yeah i – so – so this is like you <unrecognisable_speech> to upload the minute <unintelligible> correct, so this is actually a (list) work for us.
(person4) like if the annotators up- upload the minute themselves, so – (person6) actually i'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me – <ehm> i should think it over and i didn't do it yet.
because i have to send them what all the files manually, otherwise – so i don't know how to do that.
now it's absolutely okay, that we just send them the data.
(person5) so, <unrecognisable_speech> [person6], so <ehm> – so <ehm> – let – [person4] said in the morning – i also like – to some extent i thought and i – i think i also believe to some extent – so – <ehm> <unintelligible> we have an actually manual evaluation <unintelligible>.
i – i need the al- i – understood we need the alignment, but <ehm> i was talk <unintelligible>, so we must have a measure or a <unintelligible> by which we can use the alignment to produce something.
okay, so i'm <unintelligible> typing in that – <ehm> in that – (person6) just form the question.
so this is what – <ehm> if you would ask [person5] this question he would probably say that <ehm> <unintelligible> think about it and <ehm> make o <ehm> or invent the measure or metric for – for that.
okay, so, it – i do see th- this coming within october, that i'll be <unintelligible> measure and that is accepted that, okay?
so the thing is that this is <unintelligible>, right?
<ehm> i <parallel_talk> okay.
(person6) rather <ehm> – go- either think with [person3] about <ehm> – about that or <ehm> think <ehm> with [person3], [person4] and [person5], not me, i don't know.
(person4) and then somebody <unintelligible> just <unintelligible> repeated this that – this that – this that, so you <unintelligible>.
(person4) <mmhm> no, it's not very subjective, it's like – we i – i think – did you read the document that i wrote?
<typing> <unrecognisable_speech> okay, so, like – okay, so the thing is that if we don't come up <ehm> with the alignment based manual evaluation <unintelligible>, we will do as the normally the other (energy) task <unintelligible> <ehm> entries, right?
that's – yes, okay, why not.
(person6) so <ehm> really <ehm> we want to use <ehm> alignment annotation for summarisation, this is variant a. but we have <ehm> (little) time and very probably we don't have to <ehm> prepare this alignments.
yes, so <ehm> – so the thing is that <ehm> my <ehm> <unrecognisable_speech> before november it would be difficult to come up with the alignment (this score), so <ehm> for the (past) shared task that we have (way) to propose <unintelligible> speech, i think we should go whatever is available and whatever is (better) to us.
<unintelligible> so, i now loose – i know there are many autoatic measures for summarisation so if we like just put those <ehm> in the proposal <ehm> (no one we) question?
okay, so, yeah so i think – i think <unintelligible> no – <unintelligible> – [person6] you wanted to discuss something?
yeah, it's how we should do the shared task and – (person6) <ehm> <parallel_talk> yeah, so – <parallel_task> so, <ehm> what i wanted to discuss <ehm> is probably <ehm> the format of the basic sample trial.
but this is – i think we should read (with) this – that format before [person1] <ehm> appears and discuss it with [person1].
(person4) so this is – i think this is the <ehm> – so it's almost like i said, but you can – i said to remove the meta-data, you can put them with <ehm> – with a (label) in your <unintelligible> brackets – (person6) yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important.
(person4) so it's – it's almost the same, so the format is stable <unintelligible> – (person6) yes, this is – well, i think i will have to discuss it with you before i begin once more about some details.
(person4) i think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like <ehm> anonymisation of – anonymi- anonymisation of the names of this annotators.
what – <ehm> what – what, like renaming in the structure in the directory or the list, or what do you – (person6) so, now we are <ehm> looki- we are <ehm> kind of <ehm> changing <ehm> the data storage from (sorbow) to gatehub repository.
(person6) somebody – so – and if i – (person4) yes, so you create the (file) – you create the (file) the document that – internal – that you have access to, or even a notebook let say, a paper notebook, and you have to keep the – the names of this collaborators or annotators, their full names – (person6) yes, this is clear.
and you will <unintelligible> record of this list – (person6) perfect, so this is okay, yes.
(person6) yes, so this is – this is what – (person4) <unrecognisable_speech> (person6) this is what i like.
because <ehm> i'm not able at the moment, i'm not sure if i can be – if i can make <unintelligible> but i – at the moment it is very complicated for me to anonymise <ehm> all of the files to – so to name general names.
so it may – it should not be the name of the annotator, but it should be some id that i can <ehm> dete- that i can determine where to put it.
(person4) yes, i told you, annot01 is like – (person6) yes, yes, in this case it is a <unintelligible>, so nw my task is to rename the files.
(person4) yes, but before that i also have – i mean, i also propose some other things but you didn't have time to discuss them, so, i'm not sure – (person6) so, let's meet today, [person4], let's meet today in person?
<unintelligible> to <unintelligible> (more) – (person4) [person5] would be – better to have also [person5], i don't know, when he's available now, or tomorrow, or – so maybe it's better to set up another meeting, like today – like one of the day in the morning?
(person5) yes, <unintelligible> something like the meeting of today, you were also present <unintelligible> – (person4) yeah.
(person5) i think the meeting pass- yeah, the meeting password is minuting, which is already there in the meeting <unintelligible> (person6) could you – could it – could you please send it to [person3]?
