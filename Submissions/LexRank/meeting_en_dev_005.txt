(person9) so this is what i would do.
(person9) yeah so it should it should it should not be that difficult.
so today at the same time we are also having the [organization6] promoting so what do you want to do with that?
(person7) so i just e-mailed you and i think it's better to e-mail [person9] that i will-
(person9) yes, please e-mail [person9] and yeah, and we'll see.
(person7) yeah, it's it's.
[person6] ok, maybe it's the ehm-
i haven't-
i haven't-
[person6] ok, i i will have some idea.
[person6] i i don't know if you have time to now i i can demo -
(person9) yes so this this last bit is something which we well we have not really done that.
yeah, so so this this is the best solution.
but it was ok.
so the the channels that we have or the videos that we have recommended was this [organization3].
(person9) ok, that's, yeah.
and and-
well [person4] is and [person12] is for german.
but others, if we do this if we do the meeting in german, sorry the meeting in english.
i i would-
[person6] i i did-
this is just this is just the that [person7] needs to start the machine to follow the sound output whatever is being played.
[person6] ok, so that you are already able to catch the audio from the let's say-
but so so plan a is crossed, like we don't want to go for it.
(person9) yeah, we have also the 8 of, the 8 of may.
[person6] so that probably it will not be a problem to see some kind of-
(person9) yeah, ok, so let me disconnect now and you keep talking and and oh this is this only end meeting.
ok yeah i'll just leave the meeting.
i can-
(person12) well if i have video that i think would be good but i can test it on our set up.
we have a mediator too, we can i can test it on that presentation platform, but.
and and see the output of that system, that would be good.
yes we have it.
and you should just like do dash the name of the file and yeah.
but in order to practice we should be able to write the video playlist file which is the m3u8 directly in the public directory.
ok, now you should see my shell.
and.
(person7) ok ok, so can you play this video?
[person6] and this is the the video streaming.
i'm going to search for the for the text input for presentation platform for you.
if you have seen-
or we can put the video in the presentation platform which actually has the the box.
but well i think it will be interesting to check it.
and in the afternoon i will not be available because i'm in another meeting.
(person7) so i i'm saying that i just shot an e-mail to [person5] and if he can join us for the meeting then we will be able to fix audax quickly.
(person12) ehm i think as long as you have a set up that i can use to test the videos and ok, i'm actually-
if you need us well you will you will know where you will find us tomorrow, ok?
(person7) and you will for plan b it is so so you will show me how to insert test text into the [organization2] presenter [organization2] presentering.
[person6] is it fine for you to have, [person10].
