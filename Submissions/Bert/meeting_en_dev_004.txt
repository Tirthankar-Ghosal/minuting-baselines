so welcome, i told [person5] so that in-, include, join our, um, [project2], um, project, um, because currently he is working on survey about, um, about getting sim card, <unintelligible> sim card, eh, from transformers, from <unintelligible> neural network so this, um, this is connected our book. and maybe you, you could write some this, some of the sections, i think. so maybe, um, you could invite him as well to the, to write in the book. unlike two, two reviews are like the default rewievs. [person13] and, so, um, where is the deadline for, for [other2]? semi-virtual organization will be considered but as an optional addont. [person13] um, last year for [project5] you say, should write to [person3] and you should wait like for whole [organization1] once. [person10] that doesn´t really seem propotional. [person13] i am going with [person4] to [location5].

[person8] and then here -

[person10] then, then i have dovolená. [person8] i have no holiday and -

[person13] maybe on, ne, on monday i am not here. [person13] i can to go to -

[person8] yeah. [person13] ah, the official <unintelligible>.

[person8] i don´t now. <laugh>

we don´t now what´s going to happen there. yeah, so we have three, three papers type d, we have no papers so far like [other7] or [project7].

so maybe we will have but we don´t know yeat but -

[person8] hm. [person13] yeah, it should, maybe the color should be changed because it would be better to have it like the <unintelligible> to be white to that the lines are visible there, um, so let the i will changed it and i will (regenerated) maybe more, more to the on [project3] as well so could be can compared, um, better. this is for, from the past week i, i already written so do you so -

[person8] hm. [person13] and, and, yeah, we are in the book. [person13] but i would, if to, if the survey´s really goog i think it could be better to send it to better, better place, better, better, better conference then black box, then [project4].

[person8] (where does) the black box (take place) this year? [person13] to, um, submited for [project4] because [project4] is only, um, like it´s a conference like that i don´t know what people <unintelligible> will be, um, um, like it will be all from, from all the fields of informatics so maybe they will not understand much of <unintelligible> much discussed if you this, this <unintelligible>.

[person5] hm. [person13] yeah, it, it make only that you will have one point, um, in [project1] but it´s -

[person5] hm. <laugh>

[person5] it´s like two options. [person13] so, so let, let´s write it somehow and you will see and written how the paper is written some nice thing so that we could submitted to like other place than [project4], black box. i think it is possible and would be the best option. [person13] because half, half of, of the -

[person8] yeah, yeah. [person8] so you always get more money if you <unintelligible> for money. but...

<unintelligible>.

[person13] you can, <unintelligible>.

it is, it could be the same. [person10] i also got more money than usual. [person13] so it, it cannot be spend for, for bonuses. i will, i will <unintelligible> that what´s allowed. i don´t know if it´s [organization2] for [organization3] but, um, [person7] bought the computer that i am now using for some grant. [person13] how many money, how much money we have. [person13] printing the books and that so. so...

<laugh>

[person8] yeah, we got a mail from [person7] that we can come to the official event, um, um, like i really not all of us but we can come. <laugh>

and maybe we don´t have do <unintelligible>.
