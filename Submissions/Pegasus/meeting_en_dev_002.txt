and when I'm out of office i have to wear the face masks.<n> (person6) because we tried one.
we also need for other purposes to test the subtitling.
and we found most of the talk talks extremely boringi think that more importantly, we should definitely have the uh, have ami and icsi data in there .<n>Because (thought) real meetings in our understanding of meetings, but they have one paragraph abstracts of coherent texts .This data set is small for the full training.
it is acceptable for some form of fine tuning, or uh, the like the development set.<n>We should give the the week will retain half of the data of the test set, and will give away half of the data for whatever purpose of the participants would like to use it.Speech recognition 2 hours are what you want .<n>Speed summarization is really thing where the impacts on speed signals .<n>Some share tasks were only 80 hours of data .15 hours of evaluation for English and 15 hours of evaluation forczech .<n>15 meetings of the like if your score would be just one word scroll like a good or bad .<n>We can take the corpus from 2006 to 2011 and kind of unintelligible> transcripts and add minutes that can be found .Annotator will now only like twice click like here is the transcript .<n>an open meadow (person6) minutes are on just on web.<n>Maybe if you share the screen and show me about the minutes live.Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on Newsquiz .<n>Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on Newsquiz .(person2) should prepare how it should look like this sample of this send reporting to the -.<n>(person1) so can we, can we just use these ids? this sessions have.<n>(person6) and this is is a small ids.
id 0 0 4.
so, these ids cannot be used to search for minutes.
because this is -.<n>(person1) and what you mentioned to the title of the session? where do i see that title -.<n>(person6) a unintelligible> approval of sentence? that's really kind of -.<n>(personunintelligible> import this minutes that you should the avoid those kind of minutes .<n>For ami, icsi we can easily provide the existing training data as the training data .We would like to download and align the training transcripts automatically .<n>It would be nice with, and also be useful for us, because there is some summarization going on .<n>If you are poor, no one the laugh> file anything against you .In this video, we will try to find the title of a session in five years .<n>We will also try to find the minutes of a session in the same period .<n>We will also try to find the date of the session .(person6) well.
it depends how much we should get from, how much meetings.
how many how many of them.<n> (person2) so i don't see [person7] on the call.
is he take part regularly?<n> (person8] propose to divide it into 3 parts like short meetings and long meetings.
so should we really take all of them like data and participants made choose divide them themselves.We are going to use the organization2 data set in the share task .<n>The first step is to find and download the pairs of transcript and the minutes .<n>We already saw a minutes they are not variable.
they are not good, they are not variable for us.
the minutes are there in the web .We decided to take the whole [organization] corpus and to pack with existing minutes, invest money in alignment and kind of an end in that direction .<n>We agregate the subset to the existing data and reach the diversity and we have more data and more diverse data .We should have another, summarization corpus.<n>Let will be the [organization2] sessions summaries corpus, and that will be the transcript and the uh, and the minutes to that.<n>We should do one more corpus preparation.
that would be the [organization2] minutes corpus.(person8) it is just scripting that unintelligible>.<n>(person1) so we need to find the person who is familiar with wget, and who can download and prepare the corpus.<n>(person2) it is just scripting that unintelligible>.(person1) unintelligible> file, so that there are some of your mind that that .<n> (person6) transcript begin somewhere transcript ends and summary begin summary ends so.<n> (person1) and and inside in the transcript like, uh, uh.(person6) share the link of just pasted through the unintelligible> session, where is that chat?<n> (person8) yeah, the transcript and the minute in one format.<n> (person1) the asr and the corresponding minute in one format.<n> (person8) yeah, the transcript and the minute in one format.<n> (person6) share the link of just pasted through the unintelligible> session, where is that chat?(person6) sometimes t as unintelligible>.<n>(person1) sometimes t as unintelligible>.<n>(person6) format is not a zero and it is a question that should be kind of explicit.how much time will [person7] have and when will [person7] have time for any such of the job .Re-use the files that [person6] is browsing now .<n>(person6) please processes this, organize it, according to the dates and the names of the sessions .In this call, we organize the data from the [organization2] web .<n>We show you how to share the data with others .<n>We also discuss how to rename the data .unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible>(person8) okay.
