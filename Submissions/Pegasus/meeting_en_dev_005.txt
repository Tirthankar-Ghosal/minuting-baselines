(person9) as soon as zoom waiting to start my system froze .<n> (person7) as soon as zoom waiting to start my system froze for like 30 seconds .<n> (person9) create a file with time stamps and use [person2]'s replay scripts to to feed it to ab client and to the presentation workers .This zoom account is shared with like it's across the whole [organization] of from our building .<n>We still have this strange person m, i don't know who that is .We need something that will work remotely for the project officer and also for other guests he will invite .<n>The simultaneous time is the problem .<n> Prepare the ffm peg command which streams the video file and both provides the inputs to an ab client client on the server .[person6] actually i'm publishing on my local host so reachable.
but it expands it actually takes an inputs path.<n>We can let the video be playable both from a common web browser, vlc, because also vlc take input network streams.<n>The video box takes in input a public m3u8 URL.
and i suppose that we are able so to stream and simultaneously provide inputs to ab client.i think the most critical part is to identify the video file and to start performing test of- (person9) yes.<n> [person6] and machine translation on cascade because you know.
we will be able to justify in some way lags, not very fast streaming because of course we are all remote.
but probably the project officer will focus on the quality of the provided translation.i watched the video, the german one.
(person12) first, it the the project officer maybe considers it too easy.
because it's very stage recording the person speaks much more clearly than the tedx speaker.<n>i haven't run that through our through our system to see if that makes a big difference.
but i'm not sure that the austrian german could cause problems for the recognition.[person6] suggested that [person4 and [person12] should focus on the selection of the input.
and test it probably like separately just on using [person12] direct tools.
while [person7] and [person10] and [person6] will focus on the on the technical aspect.Every participant will be suppose to click the play button when the instruction says so .<n>If [person7] succeeds in injecting these instructions to the subtitles to all the languages .<n> pause it and then wait for the click instruction so that you would be in sync .[person6] yes, he is talking about plan c.
(person9) yes, he is talking about plan c, exactly.<n> (person10) there is no there is no practical way to be sure about this.
we could only try it and then get banned essentially.<n> (person9) well it's not it's mainly technical so if there is no technical means which seems reliable then- (person10) no there's not.[person6] are you 100% sure to to stream also the the meeting?<n>[person9] well, i think it's very good to explain how badly it it like handles non-native speech.<n>[person7] needs to start the machine to follow the sound output whatever is being played.
is also immediately recognized and sent to the like in the in the pipeline.[person6] Okay, let's take it as we as possibility to to be tested.<n> [person9] and [person4 and [person12] should select the video and test the the performance.<n> and this needs some deadlines.i told [person7] to be nasty once the test runs smoothly.
he should just take out the internet cable and see what happens.<n>i think that probably the project officer also knows that both we online text flow and the presentation platform are developed for face to face conferences.[person6] in the cruise control gitrepo are stored the [organization5] scripts [organization5] scripts used to make multiple streamings.<n> for example, we did it for example for the french watching session.[person6] the idea is to log in on the [organization5]'s web server.
upload on it the video file.<n>have the ffm peg tool installed.<n>then run ffm peg in order to create the m3u8 playlist which is a standard to for web streaming videos.<n>and also provide on on standard output the samples to be pasted in input to ab client.[person6] Okay, we have to ask to [person11] if i correctly understood in order to- (person7) yeah yeah yeah .<n>i need couple of minutes to recap our stream text to the presentation platform sorry you guys .<n>Meanwhile [person10] is testing this idea of plan c .This is an example acati docs streamer running on a local apache server .<n>We are going to fix it in order to performance likely better in terms of performances unintelligible>.<n>Since i'm running apache on my laptop, i'm able to reach the expose directory through the web browser .This tutorial shows how to transmit a video to a presentation .<n>The video should be publically available to the host persons of the meeting .<n>The project officer will see the demo through the screen so we'll be able to present both online text flow and the subtitles of the presentation .We will see which is the most performing solution.<n> actually in putting everything on the publics server.<n>You will have the problem that you are on the conference call, streaming the audio, streaming the video.
and this will probably kill your connection.[person6] in fact in my opinion putting everything on a different machine letting the demo run remotely.<n> [person7] because he unintelligible> not a plan plan c in any case we need to be able to access to the published to the public server.[person6] tomorrow the next test session at half past 10.<n> [person6] well if you would like to join us.<n> [person6] ok, i will send the e-mail with this kind of meeting scheduled.<n> [person6] so that at least i should be able to prepare the the call link for the call for all the participants .?another_language?> (person7) and the source language for the meeting will be english, right? or some other language?<n>For the video file it would be german.
probably german at least.
so [person10].<n>?another_language?> (person7) so all those list of videos in the section the finder demo input in the google document.
so i see that lot of links all those will be used during the demo session, right? [person6] as output.<n>?another_language?> (person7) ok, then i think if we have no more to
