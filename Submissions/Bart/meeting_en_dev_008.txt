 This is the same link you can find in the same – same meeting (invite) you can .
find <unintelligible> (links) for all (meetings) only .
(person6) will also – <ehm> will also function the next time we have the coffee meeting .
The university has paid for a paid version of [organization2] meet to use for coffee meetings .
The university says it is free for one hour, but more than one hour (you have to pay) The university also pre-paid for some of its coffee meetings, but it's not a good option .
An annotator listens to the audio and corrects the transcript .
He then writes from (stretch) the minutes and sends them to me .
The minutes are just for (reference of the annotators) Not all the meetings has the original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes they contain errors in – <ehm> in the content .
But on the other hand they contain real names and they don't have errors in - the content - they're not worse .
It deleted the team, but after <unintelligible> –.properative(person4) - but after that meeting, he said many times h- that he still s- sees that it should be maybe changed .
He still sees the option <ehm> better that this (teams would be created) again, <unrecognisable_speech>.
Proposal: 'We have an actually manual evaluation <unintelligible> by which we can use the alignment to produce something' [person4] 'He thought, overal the situation where they make alignments and it takes more time and <ehm> somehow it can - it – it can – it is connected with alignments' 'I'm not sure that i understand what you ask and second i'm  not sure i can answer' Proposal is a manual measure for <ehm> automatic (minority) measure .
Meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy .
Proposal must be submitted by first week of november .
There are many automatic measures for (summarisation) but <unrecognisable_speech> none of them works as [person3] realised .
(person5) There are 'many automatic measures' that are easy to compute, but we add another human evaluation score, that was the point of <ehm> the protocol .
Human evaluation in nature language (generation) is done that way, so- like – – the thing is that if we don't come up with the alignment based manual evaluation, we will do as the normally the other (energy) task <unintelligible> <ehm> entries .
Proposal should be (like very strong), and whatever we say shoould have a ground – grounded (this is to that) Proposal is not very clear.
We are not (believed here) about the alignment <unrecognisable_speech), so that's it.
The format is stable, but you can remove the meta-data and dashes, dashes is important .
You have to prepare a list with their real full names and their annot01, annot02, annot03 and that you have to put in the <ehm> folder structure .
For each annotator i have to change the name form form (zac)1, from [annotator2] to annot2 – "zac" - "anonymous" - in gatehub it has to appear as anonymous, as annot- annot01 .
"We have to like wait for [person1] <unintelligible> to actually .
actually .
Actually, i would rather probably finish it for today.
(person6) so, let's meet today in person? (person4) "We try to catch him as soon as possible" Psychiatrist: We cannot really discuss anything without [person5], because there are like decission points, decisions points has to take, so yeah.
We cannot talk about anything without him .
Psychiatrist says: "There is nothing to discuss today anymore" Psychiatrist asks: "Have a nice evening, everybody.
Have a nice night"
