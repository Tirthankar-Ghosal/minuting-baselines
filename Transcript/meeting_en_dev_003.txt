(person3) ensure that i have followed the guidelines that you have sent.
(person5) ehm.
(person3) and uhm <unintelligible> i will send you. 
(person5) yes, perfect. 
thank you.
uhm.
(person3) okay. 
okay.
and and the other think if now we have to really (mobilize) our efforts tools the proposals.
(person5) yes.
(person3) because you (know) late,
the data deadline has already come now.
it is november 30th.
(person5) november 3rd?
(person3) november 30th. 
(feasible)
end of november.
() end of november,
okay. 
uhm.
(person3) he guess.
so we have to <unintelligible>about the data about the even mission metrics.
tho- these may change actually,
but the proposal should look good with all the all the-
(person5) yes, yes.
(person3) like with all the components, 
you know.
(person5) yes.
(person3) and i <unintelligible>  i should be able to get back to all of you uh by the end of the week with the [organization1] data set.
yeah, i think i think i can.
i can lay-
(person5)  so you are now-
so now you are active uhm you are you are wo- work in hard on [organization1].
yes?
(person3) yes, yes, 
i think they if should get ready by the end of the week.
(person5) uhm, we- uhm.
week ago you said  that it should have been ready to by the end of the last week.
so actually, actually kind of wait expected that today we will discuss the annotations and these alignment tool by [person4].
so how it will this this [person4]-
(person3) yeah, okay.
(person5) <unintelligible> i actually uhm.
i 'm not really sure if we should not no no.
i don't mean that i do-
well.
by the end of november should we uhm get some new aligned data.
by using [person4]'s tool.
and already made by annotators.
do we <unintelligible> it the end of november,
should we started now 
and be really quick in giving to an <unintelligible>?
really takes time before we start (this) annotators work.
should we started?
what do you think?
(person3) uhm.
i 'm not really sure about-
like this should be started.
but i don't think that we can put that in the proposal.
this can start-
(person5) okay.
(person3) immediately but for the for the fast shared task i'm not sure like we have <unintelligible> clear or on the <unintelligible> of using the alignment thing.  
(person5) okay.
um.
(person3) so the <unintelligible> [person5] like uhm i <unintelligible> late personally i would prefer the shared task to be as simple as possible, 
because even the task is hard.
that i have late available realized by now.
(person5) uhm.
(person3) so like if you the keep like keeping the major focus on the summarization part.
like to to build summaries very close to how how the <unintelligible> are.
should be the main focus.
and the in like uhm this (envisioned) to lose the evolution metrics that we are going to propose. 
should come in the second <unintelligible> like uhm not in the fast shared task.
because that will be like then then we will mixing up too many things in one in one place.
(person5) uhm,
well, i 'm not sure if understand all the details.
uhm.
(person3) so i'm saying like uhm little skip the fast shared task as simple as possibly.
like we have already some evaluation metrics like <unintelligible> and other evaluation metrics that we have.
okay and we also have a manualy evaluation think that is prepared by [person6].
and i think it's it's good that we can involve annotators to-
(person5) but does <unintelligible> has does <unintelligible> have at least some minimal sense, 
doesn't <unintelligible> give some totaly unr- unrealistic numbers that doesn't that don't say anything serious about the quality of the annotations.
uhm.
(person6) <unintelligible> says, but <unintelligible> we are in a community.
(person3) yeah.
it's it's for summarization the rules is that <unintelligible>.
you know like, yeah.
i know like we that that <unintelligible> that.
but it's the <unintelligible>.
(person5) so actually, 
why we want to run this [person4] 's tool is that <unintelligible> has actually no real sense run estimating the summariz on the one hand, 
and on the other hand that manual metrix, manual evolutions that we have now are very very subjective and uhm kind of also very wake.
and in these keys using the (alignment) could give us a little more than <unintelligible> when at the community.
(person3) yesss.
yes.
(person5) probably if we don't put at in to the shared task, 
we kind of don't use-
(person3) yeah.
(person5) we could you.
(person3) it <unintelligible> this investigation this desert should definitelly go in the background.
ah, for the alignment thing,
because this this this could be on new contribution from (all in).
(person5) yeah.
(person3) so this should <unintelligible> going the background.
but ah like a convincing the convincing the reviews about the alignment tool.
(person5) yes, this-
(person3) the proposal would be difficult so i would propose-
(person5) maybe <unintelligible>.
(person3) yeah.
i would propose, 
yeah, so i would propose that uh before aaa like making the alignment to <unintelligible> part of shared tasks datas get the people on <unintelligible> exceptive somewhere.
and maybe <unintelligible>-
(person5) okay.
(person3) the data set the alignment tool gated accepted by the community.
and then we can refer that.
okay.
this is on ready exceptive and so yeah.
people can use this. 
(person5) um-hum.
(person3) so.
what they actually minutes that for the shared task get as go with the really conventional thing that people do for summarization.
take use rules.
you some other evaluation metrics like <unintelligible> some 
or like there were <unintelligible> metrics (late).
uhm using word <unintelligible> words distance and (stops).
uhm, so other than (rules).
(person5) uhm probab- so i am  eager so i actually want to prepared to relieve you 
and i really trust for this questions.
i not so experienced in then, 
but maybe you could also discussed it with [person1] once more.
so uhm it's in in these aspect you are definitely are are more experienced, 
and uhm but please discussed discussed it with [person1] before.
(person3) yy, yes.
yes, actually [person5], i was i was thinking too uhm evaluate some meetings based on the based on the automatic evaluation metrics that we have.
and then show <unintelligible> to all of us. 
and then we can decide that uhm which which evaluation metrics we can <unintelligible> we can <unintelligible> for the shared task. 
maybe.
(person5) could you try these metrics on the meeting on these meeting?
on these <unintelligible> set uhm i'm not (set) we will evalu- evaluate make.
(person3) yeah, yeah, yeah. 
okay. 
oh, okay, okay
so but-
(person5) so that we could get manual evalutions and also some automatic metrics, 
and then compare them.
(person3) yes, you are okay. 
so [person5], when do you need this till me.
i will schedule accordingly.
when do you need?
(person5) well, i don't really needed.
i want to know what  i do myself to be as uhm so af- so as effective as possible.
so.
(person3) yeah.
(person5) so you actually <unintelligible>.
so you you are time limited.
probably-
(person3) hello?
(person5) yes, 
i 'm thinking {laugh}.
(person3) so okay.
so [person5] what you do is like want you have the minutes from all of your participants.
send me this. 
and maybe within a deal <unintelligible> back with you all the evaluation metrics.
(person5) yes. okay.
but maybe in this case, if you have a clear understanding what should we prepare before the end of november, 
tell me what should i do?
what should i gi- give you before this.
send email.
(person3) yes. 
so i what i we do now is maybe from tomorrow on works i will start writing like <unintelligible>
i have already the components nearly.
so it start (drafting) and then uhm we will definitely come up with some gaps that we need to killer.
then i will be late i can i can see that uhm what other things we (require).
but like uhm the <unintelligible> lotion is to keep as uhm <unintelligible> simplest as possibly.
so whatever we have we do the fast shared task with those.
and in the (midway) in the background we <unintelligible>.
(person5) uhm. 
(person3) yeah.
okay.
yeah, so yeah.
if you say, that standpoint on my hand it's too like uhm give you the bit give you all the <unintelligible> [organization1] data which should be ready,
because the minutes i have downloaded.
the only thing that is <unintelligible> too properly align with the properly align with the corresponding trasncripts.
so i have to find way to do that.
and <unintelligible> also like uhm prepare in the form like the basics sample form that you require.
right?
as far the [project1] meetings.
(person5) no i'm totally lost. 
(person3) so i 'm saying that for for the you-
(person5) firts, so.
(person3) for the [organization1] data set, you need the data in the form like our [project1] meetings.
right?
(person5) yes.
(person3) yes, so that is <unintelligible> from my part .
i have to do that.
(person5) yes. 
yes.
(person3) and <unintelligible> with to you <unintelligible> finally data.
yeah.
(person5) uhm. 
<other_noise>
and what i- 
yes, this from [organization1] it's clear to me. 
what is not clear to me is what we do with the alignment of transcripts and minutes now.
uhm did you already tried this [person4]'s tool,
did you think about how to organize this annotators work.
do we begin it now?
do we begin it next week after you already with [organization1] corpus
or don't or we don't begin it at all, 
because as your seen it is not actuall for this (shared task).
(person3) no, [person5].
i i think we should begin.
i think we should begin <unintelligible> take the charge.
because i would be now fully focused till november 30th on the shared task proposal. 
(person5) but who?
i can 't, i can 't.
so you are the only person who understand how this [person4] 's tool wor- functions.
[person4] is not working for that.
so i really need person,
who will really <unintelligible> help me to begin work with annotators. 
(person3) yeah, yeah.
so i think uhm can uhm because i think [person2] was also working on integrating something into the tool
and yeah she knows.
(person5) where is [person2] actually?
she is not with us somehow, 
but i see her online. 
uhm.
(person3) so uhm.
(person5) so you, you want to you want to transfer this task to [person2]?
(person3) not exactly.
i would say that i would do it once 
and like uhm once i'm done with the [organization1] thing
and i believe <unintelligible> proposal. 
because uhm.
(person5) yes, but that means after<unintelligible> end of november.
(person3) yeah, maybe.
yeah.
(person5) because i actually i'm kind of waiting all the times,
so i don't really understand. 
if i should stop waiting {laugh},
so uhm okay.
becau-
so in this case either i wait to december.
or you transform this task to [person2].
and uhm explain her how to i don't know work with anno-
so this is really i don't know at all how this techn- technical part works.
(person3) uhm.
(person5) and [person6] indeed <unintelligible> help with this task.
i don't want how to begin.
so i know how to in how to work within the tool,
but uhm if uhm i send the link to the inc- to this tol- to my annotors 
and they have some questions, 
and they will have some questions, definitely because this is written in python,
and python mostly has problems when install in that tool.
you also experienced such problems.
and it-
so
if the annotators come ups with questions,
i would never able to answer.
so i really need a person who would be uhm by hand,
so it would really help me all the time and in in this.
(person3) yeah, so one thing that we need to be sure about the tool is like the tool is doing annotators uhm like alignment <unintelligible>.
so but the thing is that once the once the annotator does the alignment,
so what is the output of the tools.
it should be some manual score or metric or what.
so that i think you need some discussion.
(person5) why metric?
this is just a alignment, just which part of what-
so you mean uhm how it is can be useful for evaluation.
but this is another (question) yes, 
but this is not before that.
we sh- uhm
yes, this is important question.
but this is not just for that.
<unintelligible>
(person3) yeah, once we do the alignment, 
understand.
okay. 
then i will tool is doing alignment,
so how <unintelligible> going to use the alignment.
so that question also let should coming (early).
(person5) uhm, so you (should) think it's come it should come immediately uhm at the same time?
(person3) yes.
(person5) okay. 
from <unintelligible>.
(person3) no, we <unintelligible> able outcome from the tools.  
(person5) we need a <unintelligible> idea how to use it.
(person3) yeah, exactly.
suppose we use the alignment.
and then um we don't know how to use that.
(person5) no.
(person3) so yes, for example, if you see uhm that (jens) that minutes fix just smaller part of the transcript 
or uhm then so then they get less as smaller number of kind of in these evaluation.
this is what we discussed with [person1] once,
and i <unintelligible> objection to that because it is not so uhm evident.
so his idea was that say for example, 
if  there is if the uhm crossling between transkript and minutes is smaller than the quality of the minutes is also worse.
uhm but it from from from my opinion it should not be always the case.
oh, because it could also be that some pieces of transcripts are unimportant or on the contrary.
so it's not so straightforward.
(at this moment) i don't have any clear answer to your question
and i also understand that it should be.
uhm it should be stated clearly, 
but i i me and [person1] have kind of strong intuition that it could help by evaluating.
uhm.
(person3) yeah. <unintelligible>
yeah, that is that is very much clear, 
that if we definitely help for the evaluation, 
because oh yeah what you think in machine translation this alignment tool or alignment metric is uhm like very helps.
similar i think <unintelligible> go for summarization when we see that <unintelligible> models <unintelligible> very good.
which is eventually alignment.
but the thing is like once we give this thing to our annotators.
i would really want to see that some tangible things come <unintelligible>.
so once the alignment this done then (mix) work.
(person5) okay. 
(person3) one we-
(person5)okay,
what tangible thing could be that uhm and the result you can 't you you get.
align of summary.
and a piece of transcript.
so kind of a structured uhm transkript into pieces where one line of summary corresponds to a piece of transcripts.
so you don't have a very long transcript 
and very long and very big minutes.
but you really ha- have a summarization office small piece of text.
so it could be so the text could be divided according of that, 
and that data in this are kind of (march and margaret) in this way.
so this is one of outputs.
do you get-
do you understand what i'm trying to say?
(person3) hm.
yeah, i've i've got it.
so you mean to say that uhm we have aligned aligned minute and transcript?
and that is the that is the current output.
and then we think that how to leverage on that.
(person5) no, no, no.
no.
i just saying that this is already a good advantage to have smaller pieces of transcripts, and a correspondent summary line.
so <unintelligible> we have other type of data somehow,
that not just big one hour long transcripts,
and long too pages long minutes.
but we also get the output like ten lines of transcript 
and one line of minute.
so enlarge so the datas different qualitatively different data set.
very have many, many pieces of transcripts 
and many, many corresponding lines of summary.
so it could be kind also ano- uhm good training data.
better.
(person3) yeah. 
okay.
(person5)  i 'm not sure if i'm say- saying it clear enough.
(person3) yeah, okay.
so uhm so what <unintelligible> [person5], 
i i i absolutely support you that we should start the this alignment thing with our annotators.
soon.
but i'm i'm not sure that if if we should include that evaluation part as part of <unintelligible> shared task. 
because there are still many questions unanswered.
(person5) uhm.
(person3) how how are do we going to.
(person5) yes, okay.
uhm. 
i i've got what you said 
and now i'm still wondering will work on that and when.
so really kind of administrative  have this admi- administrative problem, 
because i want to <unintelligible> 
and i don't know how technical.
because the tool is actually ready.
but there is some connection is missing that.
somebody should say how to download the meeting, 
what to click to make it work, 
and where to put the data.
(person3) okay.
okay, yeah.
i can i can-
(person5) if you want to transfer it if you want to transfer it  to [person2] maybe it would be also possible.
please then go [person2] and you to just agree who is doing that.
and agree on the details.
i think it-
(person2) i'm here <unintelligible>.
(person5) yeah, hi.
(person2) i was listening to you all the time, 
so you said.
(person5) <unintelligible> really?
{laugh}
i didn't hear aha now i (seen) see you,
because i just looked at them for uhm some minutes ago,
i (didn't) see you, 
that's why i was writing you.
(person2) yeah, i joined there there was a network problem.
(person5) by teh way these time <unintelligible> one instead of to.
we started an hour earlier than normally today.
(person3) no is it?
(person2) <unintelligible>
<unintelligible>
(person5) yes, we had a <unintelligible>.
(person2) <unintelligible>
(person5) well, it is actually okay and and i don't i don't mind it we started one, 
but <unintelligible> now we have one.
<unrecognisable_speech> one.
(person3) uhm. 
okay.
yeah i think uhm i can work to i can work on that.
but i think i 'm a bit too much uhm like worried about the proposal.
and also that like to create the data set before like we to have a good data of the [organization1] thing to be release just part of the shared task.
uhm so i don't <unintelligible> if [person2] will be comfortable to do that.
or otherwise eventually i can do that, 
but maybe i i will require some more time.
(person2) uhm are you talking about the [organization1] corpus creation?
(person5) no.
(person3) no, no , no.
(person5) [person4]'s alignment toll and starting align transript sum- summarize.
(person2) yeah.
so i 'm comfortable with it.
if you want to transfer it's okay with me.
(person3) yeah,
if you if you want to start uhm you can.
maybe i will join you within a week once this things are very <unintelligible> sorted out.
(person5) but uhm may i ask [person2] and thirtankar if you could just join to you to together
and discr- and discuss the technical details.
and and how we how the work could be started.
say till i don't know. 
thursday.
friday.
so (that we could) already speak (??about )  on friday and started on monday.
(person3) uhm.
so you are looking forward the start (date??) for the annotators to do the annotations from monday on worse.
next monday on worse, okay?
(person5) are are <unintelligible> i 'm looking forward to started from this from september, 
because i think we have a lot of data
and i 'm so i 'm still (waiting on terms) for creating uhm kind of uhm double summarize for meetings that are already minuted.
and i (am afraid) we they will <unintelligible> annotators will be away,
because they start <unintelligible> finish before they make <unintelligible> alignment.
so i would be very glad to uhm make the task the anno- ask the annotators to make the alignment.
i'm sure if we will have enough money next year for example.
so it's really important.
it's a big very big work this alignment it really take a lot of time.
(person2) uhm.
(person5) 130 minutes for english.
and 110 minutes for czech.
it's really very, very big work.
and <unintelligible> to be started as as soon as possible.
(person3) yeah.
okay, so, and and annotating [person5] i would one to mention like before <unintelligible> giving the minutes to the annotators we must be sure that which transkripts or minutes <unintelligible> really part of the data set, 
because some of them-
(person5) yes.
(person3) has <unintelligible>.
(person5) yes.
i think about it.
i think about that, 
and probably excludes some <unintelligible> meetings, 
and some other meetings 
and i uhm i will definitely start with imaging center of the shore <unintelligible>.
(person3) okay.
(person2) so [person5] what exactly do you want as one from us like to start the annotation work, because i think we should do it as soon as possible, 
because it will it is going to get a lot of time.
(person5) [person3] knows that.
because he spoke with <unintelligible> 
and he will explain you what to do.
and after you <unintelligible> the topic, 
we will <unintelligible> discuss it on friday.
and then i expect that you will say me, 
what should i say to annotators.
so.
what what <unintelligible> i just try to my annotator know you will do the alignment of this and this,
you find guidelines on this link.
this are these are the guidelines that we already-
(person2) okay.
(person5)  created by a [person4] and me.
and <unintelligible> his girlfriend, who is <unintelligible> annotators.
and please install it here,
if you have problems with installation makes so and so.
and but especially if we want to know uhm just i don't know where is the data are,
how they get to the data.
so this is what i 'm not sure about.
oh just the whole process of annotations so for on your sight is the decision how the annotation looks look <unintelligible> where is the data,
do i send the data, 
we have once started to put all our data to github,
but we didn't finish it.
so how now i 'm <unintelligible> sure what to do with the (data).
(person3) [person5], okay, okay.
so i <unintelligible> by the end of this week you have will you will have answers to all of this.
(person5) okay. 
thank you.
(person3) yeah.
so by the end of the week, 
we will have answers to all of this to connect to the annotators.
and you <unintelligible> we can also <unintelligible> session with your annotators to show them that how to do it.
(person5) yes, yes.
but yes- <unintelligible>
first we speak about it but that i will i can org- so this is the topic you ar- you actually promised me last week that we could make this call with annotators but what do we <unintelligible> them?
(person3) yeah.
(person5) thank you.
this is definitely what you what i need.
(person3) yeah, okay.
(person5) uhm.
(person3) okay,
this will be done.
by the end of this week.
this should be done.
(person5) perfect.
thank you.
now it seems that our talk is remain aha six minutes remaining.
okay.
(person2) so if you want my help, 
[person3] you can let me know, if i have-
(person3) yeah, yeah, yeah.
i i have to schedule a session with you [person2], 
because uhm there are too many things on my plate now,
so i will definitely need hands.
(person2) yeah, yeah.
you can tell me whatever you one may help with.
i will do that.
(person3) yeah, sure, sure.
(person2) uhm.
(person3) and and any decision points from [person1],
because [person6] was mentioning that we even to talk [person1] regarding some decision questions.
so are there things on our plate?
(person5) from my sight nothing happend.
because  i i didn't speak with [person1].
i had the f- so  i think we ho- we will as- he will join us uhm when we discuss the evaluation maybe,
not today.
(person3) uhm.
(person5) uhm i didn't speak to him, 
i didn't so uhm we don't have the con- concrete topic to ask him,
so so i didn't do it.
(person3) yeah, yeah.
okay, so let me know things now.
(person5) if you noted to the agenda, 
it will be it would be great.
i didn-
(person3) yeah, yeah.
(person5) fine it's really it's really <unintelligible> do in but to the <unintelligible> do that.
(person3) okay, we put that to the agenda,
like i'm like <unintelligible> so many things,
so it's the proposal that data for [organization1] 
and uhm and a tool.
annotators tool.
(person5) yes. 
(person3) okay.
okay, okay [person5].
so i think i think we can have something by the end of the week for all of this.
(person5) yeah, perfect.
perfect.
(person3) yeah.
(person5) well, okay.
is it all for today?
(person3) yeah, okay, okay from my sight.
anything [person6] would like to add maybe?
(person6) uhm, no.
(person5) 3 minutes.
{laugh}
(person3) yeah.
(person5) okay.
well then have nice time 
and that's work hard.
(person3) yes, and now the deadline <unintelligible>.
(person5) i'm i'm looking forward to that [organization1] data to <unintelligible>.
(person3) yeah, yeah, yeah.
[person5], you should you should have it by the end of this week.
(person5) are really uhm eager to see them.
really-
(person3) yeah, yeah.
(person5) how it look.
(person3) okay.
(person5) well, thanks.
and <unintelligible>.
(person3) thank you. 
yeah.
<unintelligible> take care.
(person2) okay, bye bye guys.
(person3) we will see tommorrow, yeah. 
by there.
